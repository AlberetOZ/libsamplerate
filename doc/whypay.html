Why you should pay:

   - You are deriving a benefit from Mega Nerd's code.
   - Employing someone to write code to do the same job would
     cost at least 5 times as much as licensing our code.
   - Mega Nerd uses the income to fund the writing of more Free 
     Software. Mega Nerd has no managers, no marketing people 
     and does its best to minimise overheads. Over 90% of Mega 
     Nerd's after tax income goes to paying developers to write 
     Free Software.
